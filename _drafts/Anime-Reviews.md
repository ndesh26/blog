I have binge watched a handful of animes this winter break. I thought why not try writing some short reviews about them.

* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

</p>

This is the highest rated anime series on MAL as of now that's the reason I chose to watch it in the first place. This series contains a
perfect blend of emotion, action, humour and mystery. It keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time. It has a single arc throughout
the series which makes it even more engrossing. The series has 4 different opening and ending songs and all of them are really and some of them
really standout like Again by Yui. The character designs are good and the animation is decent, the actions scenes are well choregraphed.
Though we don't see much development in the main characters. Overall it's a great and you won't feel bored with this one. 

* Steins;Gate
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

This is the anime that stands out among the science fiction genre. The way the time travel and it's repcursions are depicted is pretty
beliaveable. The chemitry betweem the main characters is great. The story is set in a utopian world where a organistion named SERN has
developed a machine which lets send data in past. 

* Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (R1 and R2)
<p style="text-align:center">

* Usagi Drop
<p style="text-align:center">
<img style="width:400px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/usagi.jpg"> 
</p>

This anime has a pretty unique story and style then any other anime in the list. It characters are unique and do not fall in any of the
standard anime tropes. It follows the story of a 30 year old male, Daikichi Kawachi who decides to take care of illegimate daughter of his
late grandfather who is 6 year old. The story relvoves around thier lives and how daikichi copes with sudden changes to his life. Rin has to
be the most adorable kid depicted in an anime. The father-daughter relation that they develop over the course of 11 episodes is the one the
best relations in anime.

* Toradora
