I have binge watched a handful of animes this semester. I thought why not try writing some short reviews about them.

* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

</p>

This is the highest rated anime series on MAL as of now that's the reason I chose to watch it in the first place. This series contains a
perfect blend of emotion, action, humour and mystery. It keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time. It has a single arc throughout
the series which makes it even more engrossing. The series has 4 different opening and ending songs and all of them are really good and some of them
really standout like Again by Yui. The character designs are good and the animation is decent, the actions scenes are well choreographed.
Though we don't see much development in the main characters. Overall it's a great anime and you won't feel bored with this one.

* Steins;Gate
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

This is the anime that stands out among the science fiction genre. The way the time travel and it's repcursions are depicted is pretty
beliaveable. The chemistry betweem the main characters is great. It starts slowly and bores you a bit in the first 5 episodes but it starts
picking up pace after that and then becomes a engrossing ride.

* Usagi Drop
<p style="text-align:center">
<img style="width:400px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/usagi.jpg">
</p>

This anime has a pretty unique story and style then any other anime in the list. It characters are unique and do not fall in any of the
standard anime tropes. It follows the story of a 30 year old male, Daikichi Kawachi who decides to take care of illegimate daughter of his
late grandfather who is 6 year old. The story relvoves around thier lives and how daikichi copes with sudden changes to his life. Rin has to
be the most adorable kid depicted in an anime. The father-daughter relation that they develop over the course of 11 episodes is the one the
best in anime.

* Toradora
<p style="text-align:center">
<img style="width:600px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/toradora.jpg">
</p>

This is the typical school-romcom where the boy and girl don't want to accept that they like each other and yet it manages to keep you interested.
The credits go to the story and the script, the dialogs are good and offer depth. The character development is good and the side characters
get enough screen time.

* Your Lie in April
<p style="text-align:center">

There is so much content to talk about this anime, I don't even know where to start. This anime had the most profound impact on me.
This anime is a must watch and avoid spoilers at all cost for this one. The show sometimes get overly dramatic and boring during 
the musical performances, but it still is worth it for the overall impact it has. I have already watched it 4 times already.
