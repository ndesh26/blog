I started learning rust early december, and the best way to learn a language is to use it. So I started looking for a project in rust and
hopefully I was able to find a project which was writing bindings for libevdev in rust. There are a few blogs which bindings but there were
certain aspects that this blogs didn't cover and I did do some digging into code to get the answers. This aim of this post is to help anyone
who wants to write bindings for a C library in rust.
