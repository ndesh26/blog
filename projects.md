<h3>App Timer</h3>
AppTimer is a android library which provides the time spent by the user on each app. AppTimer supports until Android Kitkat. It uses GET_TASKS permission to retrieve the app which is running in the foreground.
<ul>
<li>Explored various ways to calculate the time spent by user on each ways and implemented the most efficient one</li>
<li>Developed a background service which would run at specific intervals and record the application which was running in foreground at that time and store it in SQL database</li> 
<li>The Code is available on <a  href="https://github.com/ndesh26/AppTimer" target="_new">github</a>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Studied the Stable Marriage Problem and Analysed the proof of the algorithm to solve it</li>
<li>Studied various standard techniques used in solving the problem and its variants</li>
<li>Analysed theorems regarding existence of a stable marriage in case of incomplete lists</li> 
</ul>
