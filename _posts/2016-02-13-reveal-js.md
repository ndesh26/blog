Reveal.js is a javascript framework to create beautiful presentations. 

It allows us us to create presentations in form of html pages which include a broad range of features. I like the the framework mostly because it allows to create presentation related to web development and also show the excecution of code then and there.

Though some of you may feel that it is tedious to create presentation using 
reveal.js for such people there is a [online editor](http://slides.com/) which allows you to use reveal.js without the need to code anything.

you can see the demo slide [here](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).

##How to use

You can write the following code in a HTML file and include as many slides as you want in the slides div.

{% highlight html %}
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reveal.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/white.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="reveal">
            <div class="slides">
                <section>Slide 1</section>
                <section>Slide 2</section>
            </div>
        </div>
        <script src="js/reveal.js"></script>
        <script>
            Reveal.initialize();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
