I am Nayan, a 2nd year B.Tech Degree student at IIT Kanpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I love coding, swimming, binge-watching tv series and food. I work on open-source projects during my free time. I am big ATLA and LOK fan.

I also play Squash in my free time. I have contributed to gnome-maps and libchamplain and trying to contribute to mesa.
