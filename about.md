I am Nayan, a 3rd year B.Tech Degree student at IIT Kanpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am a introvert at heart.
I love coding, working on large codebases, swimming, squash, binge-watching anime and food. I work on open-source projects during my free time.

I have contributed to Mesa, gnome-maps, libchamplain. I love to work on low level stuff. For the past year. I have been exploring the linux
graphics stack and trying to find my place in the community.

I created this blog to share intresting stuff that I encounter on the internet. But lately it has become more of a place where I document what
I am doing and the problems that I encounter and there solutions mostly the work I do on the linux graphics stack.
