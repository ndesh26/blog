I am Nayan, a 2nd year B.Tech Degree student at IIT Kanpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I love coding, swimming, squash, binge-watching tv series and food. I work on open-source projects during my free time. I am big ATLA and LOK fan.

I have contributed to gnome-maps, libchamplain and ~~trying to contribute to~~ mesa. I love to hack on code, and see the impact. I also enjoy trying diffrent distros. I also do some pencil sketching in my free time

I created this blog to share intresting stuff that I encounter on the internet. But lately it has become more of a place where I document what
I am doing and the problems that I encounter and there solutions.
