I am Nayan, a 3rd year B.Tech Degree student at IIT Kanpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I love coding, debugging big codes, swimming, squash, binge-watching tv series and food. I work on open-source projects during my free time. I am big ATLA and LOK fan.

I have contributed to Mesa, gnome-maps, libchamplain. I love to work on low level stuff. For the past 6 months I have been exploring the linux graphics stack and trying to understand why certain things are implemented in the way they are, it also has a lot of history associated with it.

I created this blog to share intresting stuff that I encounter on the internet. But lately it has become more of a place where I document what
I am doing and the problems that I encounter and there solutions mostly the work I do on the linux graphics stack.
