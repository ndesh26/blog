title: About
---

I am Nayan. I work as a software engineer in the networks division of Samsung Electronics, South Korea. I graduated from IIT Kanpur
with a bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am the maintainer of the [rust bindings](https://crates.io/crates/evdev-rs) for libevdev. I have previously contributed to the DRM GPU Scheduler which is part of the
[Linux Kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=nayan) as part of GSoC18. I have
also contributed to [Mesa](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/log/?qt=author&q=Nayan+Deshmukh), which is a userspace implementation
of openGL, vulkan and other graphics APIs. My interest areas are Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Compilers. I am always
curious to learn more about this areas and their interactions with each other.

When I am not on my computer, I would be exersing my body by playing squash or relaxing my mind by watching a TV series (mostly
Kdramas these days). I was forced by corona to take up cooking but I started liking it since then.
