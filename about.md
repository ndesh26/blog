I am Nayan, a B.Tech graduate from IIT Kanpur majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.
I work at Samsung Electronics, South Korea in the Cloud Lab where I work on openstack and kubernetes.

I am an introvert at heart.
I love coding, working with large codebases, swimming, squash, binge-watching anime and food. I like to spend my free time insides
and avoid going outdoors. I suck at group conversations and end up being the
quietest guy in the group. I am okayish in one-to-one conversations. That's about it; anyways there is no point in 
writing this much about myself if no one's going to read it. At least that's what google analytics shows :P

I have contributed to [Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=nayan), [Mesa](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/log/?qt=author&q=Nayan+Deshmukh) a bit. My interests lie in Computer
architecture, Operating Systems, Compilers, and Networks.
I interned at Samsung Electronics, South Korea during summers 2017.
