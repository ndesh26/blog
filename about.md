I am Nayan, a B.Tech graduate from IIT Kanpur majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am a introvert at heart.
I love coding, working on large codebases, swimming, squash, binge-watching anime and food. I like to explore open-source stacks 
during my free time. I like to spend my free time insides and avoid going outdoors. I suck at group conversations and end up being the
most quiet guy in the group. I am okayish in one-to-one conversations. That's about it, anyways there is not point in 
writing this much about myself if no one's gonna read it. At least that's what google analytics shows :P

I have contributed to [Mesa](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/log/?qt=author&q=Nayan+Deshmukh) a bit. My interests lie in Computer architecture, Operating Systems, Compilers and Networks.
I am interned at Samsung Electronics, South Korea during summers 2017. 

I created this blog to share intresting stuff that I encounter on the internet. But lately it has gone stale due to busy
semesters.
